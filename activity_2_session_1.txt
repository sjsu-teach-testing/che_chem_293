What does the model achieve?
- Derives a linear correlation between Car MPG and Car Wt

How should metrics be interpreted?
- Slope is the relationship between Car MPG and Car Wt for the model (in addition to intercept)

What are appropriate use cases?
- Correlating two variables with the expectation that the relationship is linear

How is it implemented? *
- Minimizing residuals (difference between model and actual values for each data point)

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- Only 3 sample points, may benefit from more data

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
- Car weight is heavily correlated with MPG, minimizing car weight can improve MPG drastically
